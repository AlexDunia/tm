# Security Policy and Implementation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in this application to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

## Security Enhancements

### 1. Injection Prevention

- **SQL Injection Protection**:
  - Implemented Eloquent ORM for all database operations with parameterized bindings
  - Type casting of parameters (e.g., `intval()` for IDs)
  - Input validation through Laravel's validation system

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection**:
  - Input sanitization using Laravel's validation rules and custom middleware
  - Output escaping in Blade templates (`{{ }}` instead of `{!! !!}`)
  - Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict script execution
  - Implemented XSS sanitization middleware

- **Command Injection Prevention**:
  - Avoided direct use of PHP's `exec()`, `shell_exec()`, and similar functions
  - Input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data

### 2. Authentication and Authorization

- **User Authentication**:
  - Strong password policy (min 12 chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
  - Secure password storage using bcrypt hashing
  - Prevention of timing attacks using constant-time comparison
  - Rate limiting for login attempts (5 attempts per minute)
  - Session regeneration on login/logout to prevent session fixation

- **Authorization Controls**:
  - Implemented Laravel Gates for permission checks
  - Resource authorization middleware to prevent IDOR attacks
  - UUID-based identification for users instead of sequential IDs
  - Session validation and secure cookie handling

### 3. CSRF Protection

- **Enhanced CSRF Middleware**:
  - Added @csrf token to all forms
  - Strengthened VerifyCsrfToken middleware with additional security checks
  - Token regeneration when needed for enhanced security
  - Secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)

### 4. File Upload Security

- **Secure File Handling**:
  - MIME type validation to restrict file types
  - File size limitations (max 2MB)
  - Randomized filenames to prevent overwrite attacks
  - File path sanitization to prevent path traversal
  - Storage in non-public directories when possible

### 5. Data Protection

- **Sensitive Data**:
  - Encrypt sensitive user information
  - Redaction of sensitive information in logs
  - Secure handling of passwords and personal data
  - Privacy by design practices (collecting only necessary data)
  - Login tracking for security auditing

### 6. Security Headers

- **HTTP Security Headers**:
  - Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
  - X-XSS-Protection
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-Frame-Options
  - Referrer-Policy
  - Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) [via server config]

### 7. Rate Limiting

- **Enhanced Rate Limiting**:
  - Implemented on sensitive routes (login, registration)
  - API rate limiting (60 requests per minute)
  - IP-based and user-based throttling
  - Custom middleware for granular control

### 8. Secure Forms

- **Form Request Validation**:
  - Custom FormRequests for all forms
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Custom error messages
  - Contextual sanitization for HTML content

## Additional Security Measures

### 1. Security Logging

- Detailed logging of security events
- Login attempt tracking
- New device notification
- Error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information

### 2. Session Security

- Secure session configuration
- Session timeout settings
- Prevention of session fixation

### 3. API Security

- Token-based authentication with Laravel Sanctum
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Input validation for all API requests

### 4. Database Security

- Encrypted sensitive fields
- Parameterized queries
- Least privilege access
- UUIDs for sensitive records

### 5. Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please send an email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com). All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

## Implementation Notes

- These security measures were implemented following the OWASP Top 10 and SANS Top 25 security guidelines.
- Regular security audits are recommended to ensure continued protection.
- Third-party dependencies should be regularly updated to patch security vulnerabilities.
